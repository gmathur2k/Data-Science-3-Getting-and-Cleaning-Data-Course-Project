## Course 3-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

### Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project has following <b>deliverables</b>:

1 README.md (this file) - briefly describes about the contents of the github project repository and how the scripts work together.

2 a tidy data set as described below, 

3 a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
   (https://github.com/gmathur2k/Data-Science-3-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project), 
and 

4 CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

### Approach

1 Understand and define the raw data, tidy data structures and the transformations to cleanse raw data into tidy data. Prepare CodeBook.md.

2 Write run_analysis.R to perform the following steps:

2.1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

2.3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

2.4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

2.5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3 Execute run_analysis.R to prepare tidy data set and attach it to the project contents.
