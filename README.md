### Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. This project has following deliverables:

1) README.md (this file) - briefly describes about the project.

2) a tidy data set as described below, 

3) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
   (https://github.com/gmathur2k/Data-Science-3-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project), 
and 

4) Codebook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
